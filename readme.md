# IVR-Security-assessment-tool
Built with Python & XML as a database.

This tool’s main focus is to reduce the time required during an IVR security assessment. This isn’t a full-fledged tool that we planned for but it’s built enough where anybody can extend it further.

For now this tool has only two major functionalities.

>Record a call flow
>Replay a call flow

For the first time the user needs to record a call flow by manually sending the DTMF tones using the tool. Then, the tool can automatically dial that number and reach to that point by automatically sending the pre-recorded DTMF values. Now the user can easily send different payloads at that point from the tool.

# Features in the future version of this tool 

>Custom Bruteforce attack at any defined point.
>SQL Injection payloads
>Buffer overflow payloads
>Input validation payloads

# NOTE

This is not the full fledged tool that we palneed to make. The full fledged tool will have all the features listed above. I coded this a year back but could not release it because it was not finished completely and I realised that for a full fledged tool, it’s better to make a GUI or Web version of this tool rather than a command line one. With the command line tool, we cannot have a good control when it comes to combining different attack vectors. We will probably make a full version of this tool with an easy to use graphical interface. Meanwhile, the code could prove helpful for a pentester to reduce the time needed for IVR pentest and it could also prove helpful to those who want to automate the IVR interaction process.
